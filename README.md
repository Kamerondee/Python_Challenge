# Python_Challenge

In this challenge we were given two different data sets, one called PyBank and the other PyPoll.

In PyBank, we had to create a script that calculated:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In PyPoll, we had to create a script that calculated:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote
